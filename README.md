built using mongoDB 6.0, so probably anything above that is fine

linux or osx compatibility not quaranteed, tested on windows

# how to use

- run `npm install`
- start a local mongodb running on default `mongodb://127.0.0.1/my_database`
- use `npm start` on topmost folder level
- navigate to `lcalhost:8080`
